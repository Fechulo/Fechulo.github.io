      <h1>My Compositions</h1>
      <p>
        Around 2018 I began playing around with <a class="body" href="https://musescore.org/en">MuseScore</a>, an open-source music notation program. Around that time I was also taking Leaving Cert Music, for which I had to analyse one of
        Bach's many Cantatas and Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet Overture, amongst others. So it was only a matter of time before I began to compose my own classical music. This page is a showcase of some of the pieces I've composed since
        then. Most of them are very short pieces which don't take themselves very seriously, often packed with references and musical 'memes'. Others are simple experiments which worked out better than expected. But there is also one
        (slightly) longer piece with a lot more thought behind it than any of the others. Unfortunately I can't afford to get an orchestra to perform these pieces for me, but MuseScore does offer a fairly decent MIDI playback feature, so
        you can at least get an idea of what these pieces sound like. I hope you enjoy!
      </p>

      <h2>Bouncingly in D</h2>

          The inspiration for this piece comes from the fusion of two of my passions; music and linguistics. How can you combine those two? Well, there exists a very special constructed language known as Solresol, wherein all words are made
          up of musical notes. This means you can hide messages in your music! So what's the hidden message in this piece? Well it's nothing exciting really. The Ostinato in the Cello is made up of the notes G, B and A (or Sol, Si and La in
          French Solfège). The word Solsila in Solresol translates to the verb 'to bounce' or 'to jump'. The repetition of the last note (A / La) turns the verb into an adverb, hence <i>Bouncingly</i> (which isn't a word in English
          obviously, although bouncily is, but I guess I didn't realise it at the time so now I'm stuck with a pretty dumb name...) So that was the basis for the piece. There may be a few more words or messages hidden within the piece, I
          honestly can't remember.

          A lot of the music I write is based on whatever's going on in my life at the moment of writing. I likely wrote this piece after attempting (and failing) to study some Poetry for an English exam. The subject of this fugue for a
          string quartet is based on the first line from 'The Forge', a poem by Irish poet Seamus Heaney's: "All I know is a door into the dark". I thought maybe writing music to one of the poems I had to study would be a fun and creative
          way of learning (It didn't work out, Heaney wasn't even in the exam). Some of you may have initially noticed the spelling error in the title of the piece, however this typo is indeed a very bad pun. The piece is very forgettable
          and is based on 'The Forge'

          I don't just write music for string quartets. I have also written a few pieces for piano. These piano études are the results of my experimentation with some pretty rare scales. Even if you don't know much about music theory,
          chances are you've heard of the major and minor scales. If you're a musician, you might know a few other scales like Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian and Locrian. But unless you're an obsessive geek like me, you've probably
          never heard of the Aerogian or Bofian scales. As it turns out there's almost 1500 different possible scales (in our 12-tone equal temperament western world).
          <a class="body" href="https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/">This awesome website</a> by Ian Ring has a page with a bunch of information for every single one of these scales. Every now and then I like to pick a scale at random
          using <a class="body" href="https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/">Ian Ring's website</a> and challenge myself to compose something using only the notes in that scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          The two scales showcased here are the only two that have resulted in pieces I'm actually proud of (as of September 2020). In fact, these are probably the only 2 pieces I've written that I don't find cringy to listen to. They're
          extremely dark and dramatic and I'm sure a human performance of them would be even more powerful than a MIDI one. Unfortunately my piano skills are nowhere near good enough to even attempt to play these pieces and even if they
          were, some of the passages would require more than two hands to play...
