      <h1>My Instrument Collection</h1>
      <p>Over the years I've accumulated a number of musical instruments, only some of which I can actually play. This page is a showcase of all the instruments I own and some information about each one.</p>

      <h1>Yamaha TRBX304 Bass</h1>
      <p>When people ask what instrument I play, I usually say bass guitar, as this is by far the instrument I've played the most in recent years. I only got <i>Ash</i> a few years ago <i>(Yes, I do name some of my instruments, very pretentious, I know)</i> after spending a long time playing basslines on my (far too high-pitched) guitars. Although I don't like the stereotype of bad guitar players becoming mediocre bass players, that's exactly what happened in my case...</p>

      <h1>Classical Guitar</h1>
      <p>First music instrument I learned to play back in 2009. This one actually belonged to my dad. I had a much smaller guitar back then but I grew and it didn't.</p>

      <h1>"Gibson" Les Paul Electric Guitar</h1>
      <p>It took a fair bit of convincing, but my parents eventually got me an electric guitar, which I named <i>Ellie</i>. Although not an actual Gibson, Ellie is most certainly a stunning instrument. I don't play her very often anymore. In fact, she's been missing a high E string for quite some time</p>

      <h1>Epiphone Acoustic Guitar</h1>
      <p>This one doesn't belong to me actually but its real owner has yet to notice its absence. I "borrowed" it for a Music Competition I took part in (and won) in Prague. I used this instrument for a song that required a guitar in open G tuning, so I bought some <i>very</i> high-tension strings that could survive a significant drop in tension. Unfortunately, they make the guitar practically unplayable in standard E tuning.</p>

      <h1>Laka Ukulele</h1>
      <p>Onto the last of my named instruments. Behold <i>Lala</i>. After becoming obsessed with the idea of owning a Ukulele a few years back, I set out to get myself a Uke for under €30 and ended up getting this beautifully resonant Ukulele for €99... Thanks to its size, I've actually been able to bring Lala on some of my trips, having traveled as far as South America!</p>

      <h1>Kawai X30 Keyboard</h1>
      <p>Moving away from the plucked strings section, this is my keyboard. It belonged to my late grandmother originally, who passed it on to my father who eventually (sort of?) passed it on to me. I've recently been teaching myself some music theory and keyboards are by far the best instruments for this. Unfortunately I can't play very well but I have been learning Erik Satie's "Gymnopédie No.1" in an attempt to get better at piano.</p>

      <h1>Hohner 32-key Melodica</h1>
      <p>This is my Melodica, gifted to me by my girlfriend (who now regrets giving it to me). Once again, I'm no good at it, but I can play the iconic "Clint Eastwood" melody by Gorillaz. I hope to someday be able to play any of Jacob Collier's mind-blowing melodica solos, although I might need</p>
